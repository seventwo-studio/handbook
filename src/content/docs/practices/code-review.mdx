title: Code Review Standards
---

## Overview

Code review is a critical quality control process at SevenTwo Studio. Reviews catch bugs, improve code quality, share knowledge, and ensure consistency. Our code review standards balance thoroughness with development velocity.

## Reviewer Requirements

Pull requests require approval from at least one reviewer when created by AI agents. For human-authored code, approval is required from code owners as defined in the CODEOWNERS file. This ensures appropriate expertise reviews each change.

Code owners are designated for specific directories or file patterns. When a PR touches owned code, the corresponding owner must review and approve. This distributes review responsibility based on domain expertise.

## Pull Request Size

We limit pull requests to 500 lines changed. Smaller PRs are easier to review thoroughly and less likely to introduce bugs. They enable faster feedback cycles and reduce time to merge.

When changes exceed 500 lines, we break them into multiple PRs with logical boundaries. Each PR should be independently reviewable and, ideally, deployable.

## PR Templates and Checklists

We use PR templates with checklists for consistency. Templates prompt authors to include:
- Summary of changes
- Testing instructions
- Screenshots or videos for UI changes
- Related issue links
- Breaking changes documentation

Checklists ensure authors have completed necessary steps like writing tests, updating documentation, and verifying CI passes.

## Required PR Information

Every PR must include a clear summary explaining what changed and why. Testing instructions tell reviewers how to verify the changes work correctly. For UI changes, screenshots or videos show the visual impact.

Related issues are linked to provide context and enable tracking. Breaking changes are explicitly documented with migration instructions when applicable.

## Continuous Integration Checks

PRs must pass critical CI checks before merging. We don't require all checks to pass, but critical checks (linting, type checking, tests, build verification, security scans) must succeed.

This balance allows non-critical checks like documentation builds or optional analyses to fail without blocking merges, while ensuring code quality and functionality.

## Automated Checks

Our CI pipeline runs comprehensive automated checks on every PR:
- Linting to enforce code style
- Type checking to catch type errors
- Unit and integration tests to verify functionality
- Build verification to ensure successful compilation
- Security scans to detect vulnerabilities
- Preview deployments for visual verification

These automated checks catch many issues before human review, allowing reviewers to focus on logic, architecture, and maintainability.

## Review Response Time

We aim to provide initial feedback on pull requests within 24 hours. Timely reviews prevent work from piling up and keep developers productive. Reviewers prioritize PRs to maintain team velocity.

When reviews require significant time, reviewers acknowledge the PR quickly and provide an estimated timeline for thorough review.

## Review Focus Areas

Reviewers focus on:
- Correctness: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Testing: Are there adequate tests for the changes?
- Architecture: Does the implementation fit the existing design?
- Maintainability: Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Security: Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
- Performance: Are there obvious performance issues?

Reviewers don't nitpick style issues that automated tools should catch. They focus on substantive concerns that affect code quality and functionality.

## Constructive Feedback

Reviews provide constructive, specific feedback. Comments explain why changes are suggested and, when possible, provide examples or alternatives. Reviews are respectful and assume good intent.

We distinguish between blocking issues that must be fixed and suggestions that could improve the code but aren't critical. This helps authors prioritize changes.

## Handling Disagreements

When reviewers and authors disagree, they discuss the issue synchronously (video call or in person) rather than through extended PR comment threads. This resolves disagreements faster and with less friction.

If disagreements persist, we escalate to technical leads or team consensus through broader discussion.

## Approving with Comments

Reviewers can approve PRs with non-blocking suggestions. This enables merging while indicating areas for future improvement. Authors address blocking issues before merge and note non-blocking suggestions for follow-up work.

## Preview Deployments

We create preview deployments for every pull request. Preview deployments allow reviewers and stakeholders to interact with changes in a live environment. This catches issues that aren't apparent in code review.

Preview URLs are automatically added to PR comments for easy access.

## Post-Merge Responsibility

Authors monitor deployments after merging to catch issues early. If problems arise, authors are responsible for fixing them promptly or reverting the PR.
