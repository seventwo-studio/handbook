# SevenTwo Studio Principles

This repository contains the core principles that guide how we operate as a product studio and build products.

## Who We Are

SevenTwo Studio is a **product studio** building consumer products and B2B/B2C developer tools (APIs, platforms) that enable new capabilities and reduce complexity in people's lives. We operate as a lean team (1-2 people), shipping multiple products at different stages.

## What's Inside

### Engineering Principles
Developer velocity, pragmatic solutions, and technical excellence that enables speed.

We maintain strict code quality standards including TypeScript strict mode, mandatory tests for new features, and never bypassing linter rules with ignore comments. Our git workflow is uncompromising—we never use --no-verify and always require commit signing. The architecture balances simple and boring foundations with modern scalability, starting monolith-first while maintaining modular design. Our definition of done is comprehensive: features must be shipped to users, tested thoroughly, monitored with proper metrics, and documented for the team.

### Product Principles
Design-driven, user-centric approach to building products people love.

Our product studio philosophy embraces building multiple products simultaneously while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles. We focus on solving real problems that enable new capabilities and reduce complexity in users' lives. Self-explanatory design with exceptional UX is non-negotiable, ensuring products are intuitive from first use. We ship in small frequent releases when possible, sweating every detail with quality and craft. Community-driven support scales our impact while data-driven decisions keep us grounded in reality.

### Operational Principles
How we work as a lean, agile studio focused on speed and quality.

We embrace flexible autonomy where team members manage their own schedules and work when they're most productive. Communication is async-first with ad-hoc meetings only—no standing meetings that drain maker time. Decentralized decision-making empowers those doing the work, prioritizing speed over perfect consensus. Our blameless culture focuses on learning from mistakes rather than assigning fault. As we grow, we fiercely protect our core values: agility to move fast, code quality that enables velocity, and product quality we're proud of.

## Development

This is a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| `pnpm install` | Installs dependencies |
| `pnpm dev` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `pnpm build` | Build your production site to `./dist/` |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## Contributing

These principles are living documents that evolve as we learn and grow. If you see something that should be updated or added, create a branch with your changes, submit a pull request with context about why the change matters, and get team review before merging. This collaborative process ensures our principles reflect our actual practices and values.

## Core Values

We're **design-driven**, committed to building beautiful and intuitive products with exceptional UX. A **user-centric** philosophy means deep understanding of user needs drives every decision we make. Our dedication to **quality and craft** is absolute—we never ship something we're not proud of. **Speed and agility** enable rapid experimentation, helping us ship fast and stay nimble in changing markets. **Technical excellence** is foundational, as code quality directly enables our long-term velocity and ability to iterate.
